      "excerpt": "March 23, 1987: Hollywood in the twilight of the Cold War. Three weeks earlier, Ronald Reagan—who had headed the Screen Actor’s Guild in the heyday of anti-communist paranoia, and had been an FBI informant within the industry—goes on television to finally accept responsibility for his administration’s secret weapons sales to Iran. The miniseries Amerika, which depicts a near-future United States under Soviet control, has recently aired on ABC. The Eastern Bloc is groaning in anticipation of imminent collapse. At the American Film Institute, a group of Hollywood veterans meets with a visiting delegation from the USSR, led by Elem Klimov, director of Come And See and head of the Soviet filmmakers’ union. They are here to watch each other’s films as part of a panel called “Beyond Stereotypes,” to be followed by a three-hour discussion between Klimov and actor-director Sydney Pollack at the Director’s Guild Of America.",

The Soviet Union was also dominated by Russian culture, and inherited its taste for oblique metaphor and indirect address.

But it was also an environment with a Cold War mythos that was very different from that of the West. The Soviets did have a “worthy villain,” whom they beat year after year on the big screen: the Nazis. The Soviet Union was the hero who slew the dragon; defeating the Third Reich was a point of national pride. There would never be a more important opponent.

Exhaustively long World War II spy stories with way too many characters were surefire successes with Soviet audiences; On Thin Ice, The Shield And The Sword, and Teheran ’43—the top-grossing Soviet films of 1966, 1968, and 1981—all belong to the genre. (Other winning formulas: comedies about bumbling criminals, dramas about pilots, movies in which characters take vacations.) The most popular Soviet action movie, White Sun Of The Desert, is about a Red Army soldier fighting bandits during the Russian Civil War; the successful Elusive Avengers film series (The Elusive Avengers, The New Adventures Of The Elusive Avengers, The Crown Of The Russian Empire) was set during the same era. As far as Soviet pop culture was concerned at the peak of the Cold War, the best enemies were all in the past.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Americans couldn’t be expected to kill or die for their cause, because—as the 1965 spy film Game With No Rules, set in Berlin at the start of the Cold War, suggests—they didn’t have a cause to begin with. Instead, the rare American antagonists of popular Soviet film were portrayed as pawns of business interests, military-industrial collusion, or, of course, the Nazis. Portraying a monolithic United States of true believers, focused on the eradication of the USSR, would have gone against two essential aspects of the mythology of Soviet propaganda: the defeat of Nazism, which rid the world of an evil the likes of which it would never see, and the notion of communism as a self-evident ideal.</p>\n<p>For decades, Soviet media attacked the United States—with varying degrees of subtlety—as a broken society, its failure obvious.

          "content": "<p><blockquote>\n<p> And yet the Americans still aren&rsquo;t villains; they&rsquo;re victims. Both sides of the Cold War often depicted the other&rsquo;s citizenry as victimized, but the Soviet Union elevated it into an art, much in the way that the American mainstream developed the Soviet super-villain into a fetish object. Instead of portraying Americans as eroticized torturers, inhuman strongmen, or sinister ringleaders, the few Soviet movies that do pit Soviet and American characters against each other mostly portray Americans as misled or misinformed.</p>\n<p>The Soviet and American mainstreams expressed themselves in radically different ways, with different fears. Being a single party state, the Soviet Union was always factionalist and unsustainable, and could only perpetuate itself through cycles of repression and repudiation. Its anxieties were mostly directed toward itself; as the Americans made fantasies of threat, the USSR made fantasies of stability and global standing. The Soviet Union was also dominated by Russian culture, and inherited its taste for oblique metaphor and indirect address. (It should be noted that the three greatest filmmakers to come out of the Soviet Union&mdash;Sergei Eisenstein, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Aleksei German&mdash;never completed a film set in the present day.)</p>\n<p>Simply put, it wasn&rsquo;t an environment that was primed to depict the Cold War directly. But it was also an environment with a Cold War mythos that was very different from that of the West. The Soviets did have a &ldquo;worthy villain,&rdquo; whom they beat year after year on the big screen: the Nazis. The Soviet Union was the hero who slew the dragon; defeating the Third Reich was a point of national pride. There would never be a more important opponent. The Soviets couldn&rsquo;t reasonably elevate the Americans to the same status, or even to the status of the White Guard of the bloody Russian Civil War&mdash;the USSR&rsquo;s origin-story villains, in a way.</p>\n<p>Seventeen Moments Of Spring&mdash;the Soviet Union&rsquo;s most popular TV miniseries, and a touchstone of Soviet pop culture&mdash;was about a Soviet spy in Nazi Germany. Exhaustively long World War II spy stories with way too many characters were surefire successes with Soviet audiences; On Thin Ice, The Shield And The Sword, and Teheran &rsquo;43&mdash;the top-grossing Soviet films of 1966, 1968, and 1981&mdash;all belong to the genre. (Other winning formulas: comedies about bumbling criminals, dramas about pilots, movies in which characters take vacations.) The most popular Soviet action movie, White Sun Of The Desert, is about a Red Army soldier fighting bandits during the Russian Civil War; the successful Elusive Avengers film series (The Elusive Avengers, The New Adventures Of The Elusive Avengers, The Crown Of The Russian Empire) was set during the same era. As far as Soviet pop culture was concerned at the peak of the Cold War, the best enemies were all in the past.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Americans couldn&rsquo;t be expected to kill or die for their cause, because&mdash;as the 1965 spy film Game With No Rules, set in Berlin at the start of the Cold War, suggests&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t have a cause to begin with. Instead, the rare American antagonists of popular Soviet film were portrayed as pawns of business interests, military-industrial collusion, or, of course, the Nazis. Portraying a monolithic United States of true believers, focused on the eradication of the USSR, would have gone against two essential aspects of the mythology of Soviet propaganda: the defeat of Nazism, which rid the world of an evil the likes of which it would never see, and the notion of communism as a self-evident ideal.</p>\n<p>For decades, Soviet media attacked the United States&mdash;with varying degrees of subtlety&mdash;as a broken society, its failure obvious. Capitalism and Western democracy weren&rsquo;t values that could inspire the same kind of commitment as communism, and the only reason anyone would fight for them was because they&rsquo;d didn&rsquo;t know better.</p>\n</blockquote></p>",
